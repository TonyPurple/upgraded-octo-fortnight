# The Green Square Machine: Gaming the System Like a Pro

Because apparently, your worth as a developer is measured in little green squares these days.

Since we live in a world where your commit frequency is more important than your actual code, we're all pressured to maintain an ever-green GitHub profile like some sort of digital Chia Pet.

Instead of fighting this ridiculous system, I decided to be cynical and game it with some automation. After all, if they're going to judge us by meaningless metrics, we might as well excel at them efficiently.

### The "Look How Active I Am" Script

There's any numbers of ways you could set this up, but mine goes a little something like this:

```bash
# This beauty updates this README and commits it
# Because apparently that's what impresses people now
```

All you need is a simple script that:

- Edits a file (let's call it `please_hire_me.txt`)
- Commits the change with some pseudo-meaningful message
- Pushes it to GitHub while you're busy doing actual work

I used an SSH key and systemd to manage the SSH agent.
Then, I just set up a systemd service to run the script, and a systemd timer to trigger the service so now I watch those green squares keep rolling in like clockwork.
no interruptions - just pure, automated "productivity."

## The Bottom Line

Is this ridiculous? Absolutely. But so is judging developers by their GitHub activity graphs. At least this way, you're demonstrating:

- Automation skills
- System administration
- A healthy understanding of corporate absurdity
- The ability to work smarter, not harder

_Because in a world obsessed with vanity metrics, sometimes the best solution is to automate the vanity._

_P.S. If anyone asks, you're not gaming the system - you're "optimizing your online presence through automated DevOps practices." That's corporate-speak for "working smarter."_
